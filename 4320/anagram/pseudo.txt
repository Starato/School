getAndFilterInput():
    ask the user for 1st word
    ask the user for 2nd word

    use for loop to filter out invalid characters such as numbers
    and special characters
        if character in 1st word is not empty and an alphabet
            send it to filtered string
        if character in 2nd word is not empty and an alphabet
            send it to filtered string
    
    send the new strings to an array, so we return 1 object rather
    than 2

checkAnagramAndPalindrome(array with filtered strings):
    filter the string to all lower case for comparison
    
    make a dictionary with all the variables for condition check

    if the length of the strings are not equal
        append an error message to dictionary
        return dictionary

    if sorted string 1 and sorted string 2 are equal
        update dictionary anagram status to True

    if reversed string 1 and string 2 are equal
        update dictionary palindrome status to True

    return dictionary

results(dictionary):
    To check condition and print out message for user

    if palindrome is false and anagram is True
        both strings are anagrams, but not palindrome
    if palindrome is true and anagram is false
        both strings are palindrome but not anagram
    if palindrome and anagram is true
        both strings are palindrome and anagram

main():
    fire all the other functions



BigO:
The for loop in input function is iterating through 2 strings which should be O(n)
There are 2 sorted() method when looking at palindromes, which are iterating through a string which each
of them be O(n).

Adding them together to get 0(2n), which simplifies to O(n)
